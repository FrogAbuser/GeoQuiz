        <p><b>Geography</b></p>
        A branch of science concerned with the study of the Earth's and planets' territories, characteristics, populations, and phenomena. Geography is a broad field of study that aims to comprehend the Earth and its human and environmental complexities—not just where things are, but also how they have changed and evolved. Human geography and physical geography are two areas of geography that are frequently used to define it.Human geography is the study of people and their communities, cultures, economies, and interactions with the environment via the examination of their relationships with and across space and place.
        The study of processes and patterns in the natural environment, such as the atmosphere, hydrosphere, biosphere, and geosphere, is referred to as physical geography. Spatial analyses of natural and human events, area studies of locations and regions, studies of people-land relationships, and Earth sciences are the four historical traditions in geographical research.
        Geography has been referred to as "the world science" and "the link between the human and physical sciences."
